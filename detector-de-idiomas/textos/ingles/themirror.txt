The old house on Briarwood Lane had stood empty for years. Its faded, peeling paint and sagging roof gave it an air of abandonment, and few dared to approach it. Children whispered that it was haunted, and even the bravest among them avoided its overgrown yard. But for Emma, it was a new beginning.

Emma had always been drawn to old things—the history they carried, the secrets hidden within their walls. So when she inherited the house from a distant aunt she had never met, she wasn’t afraid. Instead, she felt a thrill of excitement as she stepped through the front door for the first time. The house was in desperate need of repairs, but Emma didn’t mind. She had come here to start over, to leave behind the noise and chaos of city life, and this house was her sanctuary.

It didn’t take long for her to notice the strangeness of the house, though. From the moment she entered, there was a sense of something watching her, a presence she couldn’t quite explain. At night, she would hear faint footsteps in the halls, though she was certain she was alone. Doors creaked open on their own, and sometimes, she would catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of her eye—only to find nothing there when she turned her head.

Despite these unsettling occurrences, Emma wasn’t afraid. She told herself it was just the house settling, or her imagination playing tricks on her. But one afternoon, as she explored the attic, she found something that would change everything.

The attic was cluttered with boxes and old furniture, all covered in a thick layer of dust. As she sifted through the forgotten belongings, Emma’s attention was drawn to a large, ornate mirror leaning against the far wall. It was taller than she was, with a heavy, gilded frame that shimmered despite the dust. The glass was old and slightly warped, giving her reflection an eerie, distorted appearance.

Emma stood before the mirror, captivated. There was something about it that seemed… wrong. The reflection wasn’t quite right. It was her, but at the same time, it wasn’t. She couldn’t put her finger on it, but the longer she stared, the more uneasy she became.

As she turned to leave, she saw it—a flash of movement in the mirror. She froze and looked back. For a moment, she thought she had imagined it. But then it happened again. Her reflection moved, but she hadn’t. The figure in the mirror took a step forward, while Emma remained rooted to the spot.

Her heart pounded in her chest as she watched, unable to look away. The reflection smiled—a cold, twisted smile that didn’t belong to her. Then, slowly, it raised a hand and pressed it against the glass.

Emma gasped and stumbled back, her mind racing. What was happening? Was it a trick of the light? A figment of her imagination? But no, it was real. The figure in the mirror was watching her, its eyes gleaming with a strange, unsettling light.

She wanted to run, to leave the attic and never come back. But something held her there, some invisible force drawing her toward the mirror. She couldn’t explain it, but she felt compelled to stay, to see what would happen next.

“Who are you?” she whispered, her voice trembling.

The figure in the mirror tilted its head, still smiling that eerie smile. Then, to Emma’s horror, it spoke.

“I am you,” it said, though its voice was not her own. It was a hollow, echoing sound, as if it came from some distant, forgotten place.

Emma shook her head. “No… no, you’re not.”

The figure’s smile widened. “I am the part of you that you have forgotten. The part you left behind.”

Emma took a step back, her mind spinning. What did that mean? She didn’t understand.

“Come closer,” the reflection whispered. “Look deeper.”

Against her better judgment, Emma found herself stepping toward the mirror. As she drew closer, the surface of the glass seemed to ripple, as if it were water. She reached out, her fingers hovering just above the surface.

And then, in an instant, everything changed.

The world around her shifted, and suddenly, she was no longer standing in the attic. She was inside the mirror. The room she had been in was gone, replaced by a dark, endless expanse. The only light came from the mirror itself, which now stood before her, showing the attic as it had been. But the reflection was gone. The mirror was empty.

Emma spun around, her heart racing. She was trapped. Panic surged through her, and she banged on the glass, shouting for help. But no sound escaped her lips. The mirror remained silent, its surface smooth and unyielding.

She was about to give up, to resign herself to whatever fate awaited her in this strange, empty place, when she saw it—another figure, emerging from the shadows.

It was her reflection, but it wasn’t. It was twisted, darker, its eyes filled with malice. And it was coming toward her.

Emma backed away, her breath coming in short, panicked gasps. The figure smiled that same eerie smile, its eyes gleaming with a cold light.

“You cannot escape,” it said, its voice echoing in the darkness. “This is where you belong.”

“No,” Emma whispered. “This isn’t real. This can’t be real.”

The figure laughed, a low, mocking sound. “Oh, but it is. You’ve always known, haven’t you? This place, this house—it was never just a house. It’s a doorway, a threshold. And now, you’ve crossed it.”

Emma’s mind raced. She had to find a way out. There had to be a way. But the figure was closing in, its hands reaching out for her.

In a moment of desperate clarity, Emma remembered the mirror. It was the key. If she could just reach it, maybe—just maybe—she could escape.

Without hesitation, she turned and ran toward the mirror. The figure let out a shriek of rage, but Emma didn’t stop. She reached the glass and pressed her hands against it, willing herself to return to the attic.

For a moment, nothing happened. And then, with a blinding flash of light, she was thrown backward.

When she opened her eyes, she was back in the attic. The mirror stood before her, its surface smooth and undisturbed. The reflection was gone, and the attic was silent.

Emma stumbled to her feet, her body trembling. She didn’t know what had just happened, but one thing was certain—she was never going near that mirror again.

She quickly covered it with an old sheet and backed away, her heart still racing. The house was quiet once more, but she knew that something had changed. The mirror had shown her a part of herself she didn’t want to see, a part she didn’t fully understand.

And though she tried to forget, she knew that the darkness inside the mirror was still there, waiting for the day it would call to her again.
