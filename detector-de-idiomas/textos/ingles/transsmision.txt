The stars had always been a source of wonder for humanity. For centuries, they had gazed up at the night sky, dreaming of what lay beyond, of the secrets hidden in the vast reaches of space. But as the first manned mission to the distant planet of Galatheia prepared to return to Earth, those dreams had turned into something far darker.

Commander Lena Arkwright sat alone in the control room of the Odyssey, her eyes fixed on the blue and green marble of Earth that floated in the distance, still millions of miles away. She could barely believe it was real—their home, after so many years away, finally within reach. But something felt wrong. Deep down, she knew it.

The Odyssey had been sent on a historic mission, the first crewed expedition to Galatheia, a planet on the outer edge of their solar system. The journey had taken years, and the crew had encountered things no one on Earth could have ever imagined. Galatheia was not just another rocky world—it was alive. Not with life as they understood it, but with something ancient, something that had been waiting for them.

At first, the mission had gone smoothly. The crew had landed on the planet's surface, explored its alien landscapes, and begun their research. The planet was strange, its skies a deep violet and its mountains towering black spires that seemed to hum with energy. But beneath the surface, buried deep within Galatheia’s core, they had found something that defied explanation—a structure, ancient and alien, far older than humanity itself.

Lena remembered the moment they had breached the outer wall of the structure, the excitement and the fear that had gripped them all. Inside, they had found a chamber, filled with symbols and carvings that none of their instruments could decipher. And in the center of the chamber, they had found the Artifact.

It had been small, no larger than a human hand, but it radiated a strange energy, a pulse that seemed to resonate with the very core of the planet. They had taken the Artifact aboard the Odyssey, eager to study it further, but that was when everything had started to go wrong.

The crew had begun to change.

At first, it was small things—forgetfulness, strange dreams, a sense of unease that seemed to hang over the ship. But soon, the changes became more pronounced. Dr. Malik, their chief scientist, started hearing voices, whispers that no one else could hear. Lieutenant Parker, the ship’s pilot, began sleepwalking, wandering the corridors of the ship at night, his eyes blank and unseeing. And then there was Captain Anders.

He had been the first to truly succumb.

It had started with headaches, then nosebleeds, and finally, violent outbursts. He had locked himself in his quarters, refusing to see anyone. When Lena had finally forced her way inside, she had found him staring at the walls, his eyes wide with terror. He had scrawled the same symbol over and over again—the symbol they had seen in the chamber on Galatheia, the symbol of the Artifact.

And then, without warning, Anders had collapsed, his body convulsing, his eyes rolling back into his head. By the time they reached him, it was too late. He was gone.

That had been the beginning of the end.

One by one, the rest of the crew had fallen ill. Malik’s whispers had grown louder, until he couldn’t distinguish them from his own thoughts. Parker’s sleepwalking had turned into full-blown episodes, where he would disappear for hours, only to be found in parts of the ship no one had been able to reach. And then there was Lena.

She had felt the changes too, but they hadn’t affected her in the same way. The Artifact’s pull was strong, but she had resisted. She had fought against it, even as she felt it creeping into her mind, filling her dreams with visions of Galatheia and the structure buried beneath its surface.

But now, as she sat alone in the control room, the only surviving member of the Odyssey, she wondered if her resistance had been enough. The voices were there, always, just on the edge of her consciousness, whispering to her, calling her back to the planet. She knew she couldn’t go back—not now, not ever.

The ship’s communication system crackled to life, a brief burst of static followed by a voice—Mission Control.

“Odyssey, this is Mission Control. We are receiving your signal. What is your status?”

Lena hesitated, her fingers hovering over the console. What was her status? She was alone, drifting in the vast emptiness of space, the last remnant of a doomed mission. The rest of the crew was dead, their bodies sealed in cryopods, their minds lost to the madness that had overtaken them. And the Artifact—it was still aboard, locked away in the ship’s secure storage, pulsing with that same, strange energy.

“We... we made contact,” she said, her voice trembling. “The mission was a success, but... we found something. Something we didn’t understand.”

There was a long silence on the other end of the transmission. Finally, the voice of Mission Control came back, calm and measured.

“Odyssey, we need you to clarify. What exactly did you find?”

Lena closed her eyes, trying to find the words. How could she explain it? How could she make them understand? The Artifact was more than just an object. It was a presence, an intelligence. It had been waiting for them, calling to them, and now, it had followed them. Even now, she could feel it, deep in the recesses of her mind, tugging at her, urging her to give in.

“It’s not just an object,” she said quietly. “It’s alive. And it’s still here.”

More silence. Then, after what felt like an eternity, the voice of Mission Control returned, tinged with concern.

“Commander, we’re going to bring you home. Begin preparations for re-entry. We’ll discuss everything once you’re back on Earth.”

Home. The word felt foreign to her now. Could she really go back? Could she bring the Artifact with her? Lena glanced at the console, at the blinking lights and readouts that indicated the ship’s systems were functioning normally. But she knew the truth. There was nothing normal about any of this.

The voices were growing louder.

She had a choice to make. She could follow Mission Control’s orders, bring the Odyssey back to Earth, and let them deal with the Artifact. Or... she could end it here, now, before it was too late.

Her hand hovered over the console, her fingers trembling. The voices in her head screamed at her, demanding that she return, that she bring the Artifact back to its origin. But another voice, quieter, more human, whispered a single word: No.

With a deep breath, Lena made her decision. She entered the override code for the ship’s autopilot, redirecting the Odyssey’s course. The engines roared to life, and the ship began to turn, its trajectory shifting away from Earth and toward the cold, empty void of deep space.

“Odyssey, what are you doing?” Mission Control’s voice was frantic now, but Lena didn’t answer. She couldn’t. The voices in her head were deafening, but she pushed them aside, focusing on the task at hand. She activated the self-destruct sequence, giving herself just enough time to ensure the Artifact—and everything it carried—would be lost forever.

As the countdown began, Lena leaned back in her chair, her eyes closing. The voices were fading now, growing distant, as if they knew what was coming. She could feel the pull of the Artifact lessening, the weight lifting from her mind.

For the first time in months, she felt at peace.

The last thing she heard before the darkness claimed her was the faint echo of Mission Control, their voices fading into the background.

And then, silence.
