Long ago, in a time when magic still roamed the world and kingdoms rose and fell like the changing of the seasons, there was a land unlike any other. It was a kingdom hidden deep within the mountains, its name lost to history, and its people forgotten by time. The kingdom had been a place of great power, where wizards, warriors, and creatures of myth lived in harmony. But like all things touched by magic, it came with a price.

The story begins with the last king of this forgotten kingdom, King Thalonis. He was a wise and just ruler, beloved by his people and feared by his enemies. His kingdom prospered, its towers rising high into the sky, and its fields filled with the bounty of the earth. But despite all his wisdom, there was one thing King Thalonis could not change—the prophecy.

The prophecy was ancient, older than the kingdom itself. It foretold that on the day the royal bloodline failed, the kingdom would fall into ruin, swallowed by the mountains that had protected it for so long. For centuries, the royal family had taken the prophecy seriously, ensuring that an heir was always ready to take the throne. But now, with Thalonis growing old and his only son, Prince Edric, missing for years, the prophecy loomed like a shadow over the kingdom.

The search for Edric had consumed the kingdom for nearly a decade. He had vanished one night, without a trace, leaving behind only a cryptic note that spoke of a journey beyond the known world, a quest for something that could save the kingdom from its fate. Many believed him dead, lost in the wilderness or slain by dark forces. But King Thalonis refused to give up hope. He sent his finest warriors and wisest mages to search for his son, but none returned with news.

As the years passed, the kingdom began to change. The once clear skies grew dark, the rivers turned sluggish and cold, and the crops failed. Whispers of strange creatures lurking at the edges of the kingdom spread through the villages, and the people grew fearful. It was as if the land itself was dying, a slow and inevitable decay that no amount of magic could stop.

Then, one day, a traveler appeared at the gates of the royal city. He was cloaked in rags, his face hidden beneath a hood, and his horse was gaunt and weary. The guards at the gate would have turned him away, but there was something in his voice, something familiar that stopped them.

“I have come to see the king,” the traveler said, his voice low and tired. “I bring news from the edge of the world.”

The guards hesitated but allowed him entry. When the traveler stood before King Thalonis, he removed his hood, revealing a face worn by years of hardship and sorrow. It was Prince Edric.

The king rose from his throne, disbelief and joy warring on his face. “Edric,” he whispered, stepping down from the dais to embrace his son. “You’ve returned.”

Edric nodded, but there was no joy in his eyes. “Father, I bring grave news. The prophecy is coming true.”

The court fell silent as Edric told his story. He had left the kingdom in search of a way to break the prophecy, following ancient texts and cryptic clues to the edge of the known world. There, beyond the mountains and across the endless desert, he had found a temple, older than time itself. Inside the temple, he had encountered an ancient being, a creature of unimaginable power, who had shown him visions of the kingdom’s future.

“I saw it, father,” Edric said, his voice hollow. “The kingdom will fall, no matter what we do. The mountains will rise, and the land will be swallowed. There is no stopping it.”

The king’s face paled, but he held his son’s gaze. “There must be a way, Edric. You would not have returned if there were no hope.”

Edric looked away, his eyes dark with the weight of his journey. “There is one way,” he admitted. “But it is not without cost.”

The ancient being had told him of a ritual, a forbidden magic that could hold back the prophecy for a time. But the price was steep—it required the life of the royal bloodline. Only by offering himself as a sacrifice could Edric delay the kingdom’s fall. It was not a permanent solution, but it would buy the kingdom time, perhaps long enough for another way to be found.

King Thalonis was silent for a long time, his heart heavy with the decision before him. He had spent years searching for his son, clinging to the hope that Edric would return and save the kingdom. Now, that hope was a bitter thing, tainted by the knowledge that the only way to save the kingdom was to lose the one person he had fought so hard to find.

“I cannot ask you to do this,” the king said at last, his voice breaking. “You are my son, the last of our line. The kingdom... we will find another way.”

Edric shook his head. “There is no other way, father. The prophecy is too strong. If I do not act, the kingdom will fall within the year. But if I sacrifice myself, the kingdom will have a century, perhaps more.”

The king looked at his son, at the boy he had raised and the man he had become. He knew, deep down, that Edric was right. The kingdom could not be saved—not forever. But a century was a long time. It would give the people hope, time to rebuild, to find a new way forward.

With tears in his eyes, King Thalonis nodded. “If this is your choice, my son, then I will not stand in your way. But know that you have given your life for your people. You will be remembered, always.”

The ritual was performed in the heart of the royal city, beneath the great tower that had stood for generations. Edric stood at the center of the circle, surrounded by the kingdom’s most powerful mages. As they chanted the ancient words, the air grew thick with magic, and the ground trembled beneath their feet.

Edric closed his eyes, feeling the power surge through him, pulling at his very soul. He thought of his father, of the people he had grown up with, of the land he loved. And then, with a final breath, he let go.

A blinding light filled the air, and for a moment, it seemed as if the world had stopped. When the light faded, Edric was gone, his body turned to dust, carried away by the wind.

The kingdom was saved. The dark clouds lifted, the rivers flowed once more, and the crops began to grow. But it was a temporary reprieve. The people knew that the prophecy had only been delayed, not broken. One day, the mountains would rise, and the kingdom would fall.

But for now, they had time
