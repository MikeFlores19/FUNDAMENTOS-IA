The village of Ashcroft was a quiet place, nestled at the edge of a dense, ancient forest. The villagers lived simple lives, tending to their crops and livestock, but there was one rule that no one ever broke: no one entered the forest.

The forest had been there for as long as anyone could remember. Its trees were tall and twisted, their branches reaching out like skeletal hands, casting long shadows over the village. The older villagers spoke in hushed tones of strange things they had seen at its edge—flickers of movement, strange sounds, whispers carried on the wind. But no one dared go inside. The forest was forbidden.

For centuries, the villagers had followed this rule without question. But then, one day, something happened that would change everything.

It was autumn, and the air was crisp with the scent of fallen leaves. Young Oliver, a curious boy of twelve, had always been drawn to the forest. He would spend hours at its edge, staring into the darkness between the trees, wondering what lay beyond. His parents warned him, as all parents did, to stay away. But Oliver was not like the other children. He was bold, and his curiosity was stronger than his fear.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the village prepared for nightfall, Oliver made a decision. He would enter the forest. Just for a moment. Just to see what it was like. He was tired of the warnings, tired of the stories. He wanted to know the truth.

So, under the cover of darkness, he slipped away from his home and made his way to the edge of the forest. The trees loomed tall and silent before him, their shadows long and menacing. For a moment, he hesitated, his heart pounding in his chest. But then, with a deep breath, he stepped forward.

The air inside the forest was different. It was colder, and there was a strange stillness that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. The trees seemed to close in around him, their branches twisting together like a cage. But Oliver pressed on, his footsteps soft on the leaf-strewn ground.

As he ventured deeper into the forest, he began to hear something. At first, it was faint, barely more than a whisper. But as he walked, it grew louder—a soft, melodic murmur, like voices carried on the wind. He stopped, his heart racing, and looked around. There was no one there. The forest was empty.

But the whispers continued.

Oliver strained to listen, trying to make out the words, but they were too quiet, too far away. It was as if the forest itself was speaking, its voice low and insistent, beckoning him deeper into the trees.

Against his better judgment, Oliver followed the sound. The deeper he went, the louder the whispers became, until they filled his ears, surrounding him on all sides. His pulse quickened, and he began to feel uneasy. He should turn back. He had gone far enough.

But just as he was about to turn around, he saw it.

Through the trees, in a small clearing, stood a figure. It was tall and thin, its body shrouded in darkness. Oliver’s breath caught in his throat as the figure turned toward him. Though its face was obscured by shadow, he could feel its eyes on him, cold and piercing.

For a long moment, neither of them moved. The whispers grew louder, swirling around Oliver like a storm, but the figure remained silent, its gaze fixed on him.

Then, slowly, it raised a hand and beckoned him forward.

Oliver’s legs felt frozen in place. Every instinct screamed at him to run, to turn back and never return. But something about the figure held him there, rooted to the spot. The whispers seemed to wrap around his mind, clouding his thoughts, dulling his fear. He took a step forward, then another.

The figure remained still, its hand outstretched, as if waiting for him to come closer.

But just as Oliver was about to step into the clearing, he heard something else—a new sound, cutting through the whispers like a blade. It was faint at first, but it grew louder, more insistent. It was a voice, calling his name.

“Oliver!”

He stopped, blinking as if waking from a dream. The whispers faltered for a moment, and he turned, his heart pounding. Through the trees, he saw the dim glow of a lantern, bobbing in the darkness. It was his father.

“Oliver, where are you?” his father called, his voice laced with fear.

The spell was broken. The whispers faded, and the figure in the clearing seemed to melt into the shadows. Without a second thought, Oliver turned and ran toward the light of the lantern, his feet barely touching the ground.

When he reached his father, he was trembling, his breath coming in short, ragged gasps. His father grabbed him by the shoulders, relief flooding his face. “What were you thinking, boy?” he demanded. “You know better than to go into the forest!”

Oliver couldn’t speak. He glanced over his shoulder, but the figure was gone, the forest now silent and still.

That night, as he lay in bed, Oliver couldn’t shake the feeling of those eyes watching him, nor the sound of the whispers in his ears. He had escaped, but he knew he hadn’t seen the last of the forest.

The next morning, strange rumors began to circulate through the village. An old man who lived on the outskirts had vanished during the night. His home was found empty, his bed undisturbed. And though no one dared say it aloud, everyone knew the truth.

The forest had taken him.

As the days passed, more villagers disappeared—always at night, always without a trace. The whispers grew louder, no longer confined to the forest. They echoed through the village, carried on the wind, seeping into the homes and minds of those who listened too closely.

Oliver knew the forest was calling. It had tasted his fear, felt his curiosity, and now it wanted more.

One evening, unable to resist the pull any longer, he returned to the edge of the forest. The trees stood tall and silent before him, just as they had that night. But this time, he could see movement in the shadows. The figure was there, waiting for him.

Without hesitation, Oliver stepped forward, his mind clouded by the whispers that now filled the air. The figure beckoned him once more, and this time, he did not resist.

As he disappeared into the darkness, the villagers whispered of his fate. They said the forest had claimed him, just as it had claimed so many others before. But what they didn’t know—what they couldn’t understand—was that Oliver had not been taken.

He had chosen to go.

And now, the forest had one more voice to add to its whispers.
